TODO
====

* translate B*-Tree to compactified placement
* find optimal solution
* find optimal solution for given bound
* find local optimal solution

Optional
--------

* Better performance for sweepline (n * log(n))

Done
----

* translate compactified placement to B*-Tree

Problems
--------

* The described algorithm for "placement to B*-Tree" cannot handle all admissible placements, which is not mentioned in the paper. 
* There are BStarTrees that have no admissible placement.
